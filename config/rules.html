Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#1B3F8B">Liberty Station 13</font></span>
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">LS13</span>).There are a few notable
rules we have here. If you want to
dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest. <br>

<h3><font color="#1B3F8B"><b><u>Liberty Station 13 - Rules</b></u></font></h3><hr>
<ul>
<li><b>Rule #1.)</b> Players are to remain in character at all times in regards to violent altercations and other player-to-player interactions. Murder, abduction, or status alteration (inducing long-term mental/physical disabilities) are unacceptable without a convincing IC (In Character) or RP (Roleplay) reason to do so.</li>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #1.1)</b> Status alteration does not cover stolen items, but actions which affect the natural state of your character's physical or mental state.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #1.2)</b> Changing a players' identity without their permission falls under status alteration.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Rule #2.)</b> Out of Character (OOC) chat is a peaceful environment that expects the following behavior from its participants:Do not state In-Character events in OOC. Be considerate of the feelings of others. Abusing people, being a jerk towards others, inciting flame-wars, and general harassment is unacceptable.</li>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #2.1)</b> Please don't advertise other servers on our server.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Rule #3.)</b> Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for breaking them. Players are expected to read the rules to know the boundaries of the server. Just because you did not know a rule does not excuse you from the repercussions that ensue.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Rule #4.)</b> Murder: Killing and dying is a part of the game, but there are specific rules to help control chaos.</li>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #4.1)</b> Self defense is acceptable, but the amount of force used should be in proportion to the threat to your life. (I.E., if someone throws a PDA at you and whacks you in the head you might push them or hit them a few times in retaliation, but you wouldn't murder someone for it. If a crewmember hits you in the head with a deadly weapon and seems persistent to continue attacking you then it is only logical that you would use more force. Combat has stages of progression. Do not use more force than what is needed to defend yourself or it will not be considered defending.<br></li>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #4.2)</b> Antagonists are able to be confirmed as antagonistic when there is no doubt that they are such. Finding a PDA with the syndicate panel open, releasing singularity, randomly assaulting and killing innocents, etc. Traitorous items should be used as supporting evidence, but it doesn't always confirm the traitor status. Forensic (Detective) analysis showing they're the only person who had the weapon is an example of determining a traitor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #4.3)</b> Malfunction/Insanity is not a valid excuse to "RP" beyond the boundaries of the rules.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #4.4)</b> Officers are to be in accordance with LLA's version of Space Law when handling criminals. Space Law and the Server Rules are two separate entities. The first is an IC game mechanic and the second is our definition of what is allowed IC and OOC.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rule #4.5)</b> Aiding an Antagonist as a Nonantagonist is disallowed unless a convincing In-Character/Roleplay reason can be provided for doing so.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Rule #5.)</b> Security and the Heads of Staff are positions of authority with larger responsibilities and expectations. When playing as a position of authority you are especially accountable for your actions and the safety of the crew as the job relates. </li>
<br>
<li><b>Rule #6.)</b> Using certain OOC terms (Smilies, internet speak, etc) whilst IC is not allowed. </li>
<br>
<li><b>Rule #7.)</b> Metagaming is not allowed. Metagaming is defined as using OOC knowledge whilst IC to gain an advantage.</li>
<br> 
<li><b>Rule #8.)</b> Keep your names appropriate. Do not use profanity in a name. Do not use intentionally offensive names. Use  a First Name, Last Name format. (Ace McSpace, Clyde Brink, etc.) Appropriate names are properly capitalized. Clowns do not have to fit a First Name/Last Name format.</li>
<br> 
<li><b>Rule #9.)</b> Any form of erotic roleplay is prohibited.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Rule # 10.)</b> Griefing is not allowed. Grief is defined as: The intentional OOC intent to ruin another players enjoyment or ability to play the game with no IC or RP reasons for the characters actions. Examples include, but are not limited to: killing without a very good reason, randomly starting fires, dismantling the hull, acting insane to the extent that it negatively affects others, etc.</li>
<br>
<b><u>Friendly Tip:</u> If you you're in an position where you believe you're being griefed and the admin simply replies "Legit." this is because the kill was justified and the admin cannot disclose the reason why.</b>
<br><br>
<i>"Administrators are free thinking individuals and in some cases the rules can be flexible, it is the duty of the admin to assess any given situation to figure out if there is in fact fault and where that fault lies if it does exist. If you feel that you have been treated unfairly please let us know on the forums. Enjoy the server."</i>
