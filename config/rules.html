Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold;"><font color="#1B3F8B">Liberty Station 13</font></span>
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">LS13</span>).There are a few notable
rules we have here. If you want to
dispute an admin decision, take it to the unban appeals forums. Present your case in its entirety and an admin investigation will be performed. Please be honest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<body>
<h3><font color="#1B3F8B"><b><u>Liberty Station 13 - Rules</b></u></font></h3><hr>
<ul>
 <li>1.) Be considerate towards others in the OOC environment. Abusing people, acting like a general jerk, instigating flame-wars and harassing other players won't be tolerated.</li>
<li>2.) <b><u>NOT KNOWING THE RULES IS NOT A VALID EXCUSE FOR BREAKING THEM!</b></u></li>
 <li>3.) On murder, dying is a part of this game.</li><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1) Self-defence is usually acceptable, but the amount of force should be relative to the threat to your life. (example: If a clown pushes you down and you kill him, that is not self defence.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2) Syndicate's are dangerous, and will probably stab you in the back. We allow the killing of antagonists, but make you have proof that the individual you're toolboxing <i>is</i> an antagonist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3) Insanity isn't valid roleplay justification to warrant embarking on a griefing spree as a non-antagonist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.4) Criminals AND antagonists should <b><u>always</u></b> be treated in accordance with Space Law.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.5) Unless both parties can provide valid roleplay justification, aiding an antagonist generally isn't allowed.<br>
 <li>4.) Authority figures (Security and the station heads) are jobs with large responsibilities, and thus are held to a higher standard. Choose them with care. When playing as them you are especially accountable for your actions and the safety of the crew.</li>
 <li>5.) Discussion of in-game events ("IC") in the OOC Chat Channel is strictly prohibited.</li>
 <li>6.) Using certain OOC ("Out of Character") terms whilst in-game (Smilies, internet speak, etc.) is highly discouraged. Try to avoid this, please.</li>
 <li>7.) We are highly against metagaming. This is using OOC knowledge IC ("In Character") to gain some form of advantage (E.G. hunting for the Syndicate shuttle at the start of each round).</li>
 <li>8.) Ensure your chosen character name is appropriate. Names deemed inappropriate will warrant a thorough scolding -- if you think it's inappropriate, we probably will too. </li>
 <li>9.) Try to correctly capitalize names. Names presented in a manner such as, 'baxter reed' or 'JONATHON JonES' are entirely ugly to look at.</li>
 <li>10.) <b><u>No</u></b> ERP ("Erotic Roleplay"). If you don't already know what this is, you certainly don't need to.</li>
 <li>11.) If you adminhelp an incident that has occurred that you believe to be grief and an admin replies "legit", this simply means that the reported incident was justified (or legitimate) and that the admin cannot disclose the reason why whilst the round is still going on.</li>
 <li>12.) Grief is not acceptable, and you'll find yourself in trouble for doing any of the following without good reason: <i>Purposefully ruining the game for others for the sake of doing it. Examples include killing without a very good reason, randomly starting fires, dismantling the hull, acting insane to the extent that it negatively affects others, etc.</i></li>
<br>
<font color="#73B1B7">Administrators are free thinking individuals and in some cases the rules can be flexible, it is the duty of the admin to assess any given situation to figure out if there is in fact fault and where that fault lies if it does exist. If you feel that you have been treated unfairly please let us know on the forums. Enjoy the server.</font>
